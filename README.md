# objectManipulation

To perform object manipulation in JavaScript, we need to understand the basic structure of objects and how we can interact with them. JavaScript objects are collections of key-value pairs, where each key represents a property name and each value represents the associated data. We can add, update, or delete properties in an object using different techniques.
Thought Process for Object Manipulation:

    Creating an Object: First, we need to create an object with some initial properties. We can do this using the object literal notation or by using the new Object() constructor.

    Adding Properties: To add properties to an object, we can use the dot notation or the square bracket notation. The dot notation is more concise and used when we know the property name beforehand. The square bracket notation is helpful when the property name is dynamic or stored in a variable.

    Updating Properties: To update a property in an object, we simply need to assign a new value to the existing property using the assignment operator (=).

    Deleting Properties: To delete a property from an object, we can use the delete keyword followed by the object name and the property name we want to remove.

Example Implementation:

Let's consider an example where we have a simple person object representing a person's information. We'll go through the process of adding, updating, and deleting properties in this object.
